Calculating the number of excited states, the Algorithm for all the transpositions

MAIN is made for tracking all the transpositions. Able to deal with relarively small number of free spots (about 1-7).

Main but no T doesn't track all the transpositions of 0 and 1. The main purpose is to calculate the number of excited states in a given enegry interval. Able to deal with big numbers (174-20=154 free spots).
